# üõí E-Commerce API

A fully functional RESTful API built with **Flask**, **SQLAlchemy**, **Marshmallow**, and **MySQL** to manage users, products, and orders for an e-commerce application. I used ChatGPT and CoPilot to assist in debugging, creating, and organizing.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This API allows you to:
- Manage **Users**, **Products**, and **Orders**
- Establish relationships:  
  - One-to-Many: A User can have many Orders  
  - Many-to-Many: An Order can contain many Products, and vice versa
- Serialize and validate data using **Marshmallow**
- Interact with a **MySQL** database using **Flask-SQLAlchemy**
